            I do a lot of music and creative projects in my free time c:
            <br>
            <br> I have been doing audio engineering and music production work since 2020.
            <br>
            <br> Since then, i have worked with many artists in the local Houston music scene, and have spent a lot of time in studio and even doing shows!
            <br>
            <br> Mostly i do recording work and focus on school for now, but i always try to make
            <br> time to produce or write for new projects.
            <br>
            <br> Currently, im working on a film project, a few projects with dancers, and doing audio gigs around Houston.
