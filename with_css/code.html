            <p> comments: I have worked on many different 
                code projects over the last few semesters, here are a my few of my favorites! 
                
                My most recent project was an audio sampler driven by a Raspberry Pi utilizing Python code for programming logic, and HTML/CSS for creating a user interface.
                <br> <br>
                This project was completed over the course of around 8 weeks and required intensive planning, scheduling, and ingenuity. 
                There were many different ways we creatively solved our problems in hardware and software.
                If you are interested in how I contributed to this project or have any questions feel free to send me an email.
